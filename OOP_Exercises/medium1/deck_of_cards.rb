# Update this class so you can use it to determine the lowest ranking and highest ranking cards in an Array of Card objects:

class Card
  include Comparable

  VALUES = { 'Jack' => 11, 'Queen' => 12, 'King' => 13, 'Ace' => 14 }

  attr_reader :rank, :suit

  def initialize(rank, suit)

    @suit = suit
  end

  def to_s
    "The #{@rank} of #{@suit}"
  end

  def value
    VALUES.fetch(rank, rank)
  end

  def <=>(other)
    value <=> other.value
  end
end

      SUITS.each do |suit|
